        <p> Once upon a time, there was a little girl who loved to dance. 
            <hr>
            She practiced every day and dreamed of becoming a ballerina. 
            <hr>
            One day, she got the chance to audition for a prestigious dance school. 
            <hr>
            Despite her nerves, she danced her heart out and got accepted. 
            <hr>
            From that day on, <br>she worked even harder and eventually became a famous <br>ballerina.
            <hr>

              Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude
              service. The connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point path
              for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
              without significant interference with each other, outside early spring. This
              is because of the 3D ether space available to the carriers, in contrast to
              the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers have an intrinsic collision
              avoidance system, which increases availability.
